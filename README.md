Multi Class Classification and Neural Networks
===================
Programming Exercise 3 in Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera.  
The course info can be found here https://class.coursera.org/ml-004/class/index.

In this exercise, a logistic regression model to predict whether 
a student gets admitted into a university will be created step by step.  
The details of this assignment is described in ex2.pdf

The codes are written by Octave.  
For further info of Octave please see http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/

This set includes:

ex3.m - Octave/MATLAB script that steps you through part 1

ex3 nn.m - Octave/MATLAB script that steps you through part 2

ex3data1.mat - Training set of hand-written digits

ex3weights.mat - Initial weights for the neural network exercise

submit.m - Submission script that sends your solutions to our servers

displayData.m - Function to help visualize the dataset

fmincg.m - Function minimization routine (similar to fminunc)

sigmoid.m - Sigmoid function

lrCostFunction.m - Logistic regression cost function

oneVsAll.m - Train a one-vs-all multi-class classifier

predictOneVsAll.m - Predict using a one-vs-all multi-class classifier

predict.m - Neural network prediction function
